### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Humberto, I'm very interested in software development and I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development. I started studying more than a year ago in college and alone, I use 8 hours of my day to study after work (which is not yet in the field).

Procuro bastante certificar meus conhecimentos e focado em conseguir minha primeira oportunidade no mercado de trabalho.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently  deepening my knowledge in  Java | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | SQL Server.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interested in  React.JS | Node.JS.
